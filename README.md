# Hi, I’m Alek Lukanen 👋

I’m a backend-focused software engineer who enjoys building high-performance, scalable systems. Most of my work centers around Rust and Go, with a particular interest in storage engines, databases, and low-level systems design.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On Now

- **Javelin** — An LSM-tree–based key-value store inspired by Pebble and RocksDB. The goal of this project is to build a storage engine I can use as the foundation of an SQL database.
