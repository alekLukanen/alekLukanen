# Hi, I’m Alek Lukanen 👋

A backend-focused software engineer passionate about building high-performance, scalable systems. I enjoy building database systems primarily in **Rust** and **Go**.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On Now

- **Javelin** — An LSM-tree based key-value store. The goal of this project is to build a Pebble/RocksDB like storage engine for an SQL database I'm planning on building.
